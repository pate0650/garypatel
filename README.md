# Portfolio
To Create this POrtfolio I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. First of all i created Index.HTML file.
    After that i linked the Basic CSS File to my HTML .
    then  I created Index.Js FILe for manioulate my HTML.
    ## IN my JS file Here is my Step what I did
        
        1 First make constant and call  all same class
        2 Second make an array for imagaes
        3 make an empty array for push the HTML in it.
        4 made an array for Effects.
        And the i push whole HTML iN it to manupulaiton.Then i did animation using javascript and css for make it look nice.
        
# Animation:
For animation, I used animation.css file and I link my file to my index,html file.Then I used many different animation and I add different effects.

# Responsive:
 Responsive I used the,
1 ```display:grid``` 
2 ```grid-template-columns```
3 ```grid-gap```


In some places i also had used display flex and with it help it gives much nice and cleaner look to it.
# Challenges:

1) I had the problem to set the array.Because I made a syntax error.So I am getting error for array
3) Finally the last one is like I had with the event listeners syntax.But then I solved it.
4) I also had problem while making scrolling page and navigate to on same page
